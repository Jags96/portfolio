## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Statistics Teaching Assistant, Luddy School of Informatics,  Spring 2025 
- Worked as a TA for the Master's level course INFO-H 510 Statistics for Data Science. This course offers an introduction to statistics for Master's students, generally those studying Applied Data Science, with a focus on applying the statistical topics studied in the class via R programming.



## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS EXPERIENCE 
### Python Code Generator – Transformer-Based Model [Github](https://github.com/Jags96/CodeGen) 						        Fall 2024
- Developed and performed inference a custom Transformer model (5M parameters) for Python code generation, leveraging GPT-2 architecture.
- Pre-trained the model on the CodeParrot dataset (~50 GB) from Hugging Face using A100 GPUs, with random weight initialization.
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 (124M) and Llama 2 (7B) models for enhanced Python code generation capabilities using GPUs.

### RAG Pipeline – FAQ-Based Question-Answering System [Github](https://github.com/Jags96/RAG) 					        Fall 2024
- Engineered a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing the Ollama 2 LLM model for prompt generation and response generation.
- Integrated semantic Elasticsearch for advanced query matching and text retrieval, improving answer accuracy and relevance.
- Optimized model performance by fine-tuning with vector similarity metrics and the LLM-as-a-judge methodology.
- Utilized FAQs(~2000 questions) from an online course (ZoomCamp) as the primary database for the RAG model, enhancing question-answer matching.

### Apartment Recommender – Content-Based Filtering System [Github](https://github.com/Jags96/Score-Apartment-Recommender)   					        Fall 2024
- Designed a content-based filtering model to analyze user preferences, generating personalized apartment recommendations (from nearly 10k apartments).
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and pairwise similarity metrics, improving the efficiency of recommendation generation by 20% while reducing computational overhead.
- Implemented a count-vectorizer to improve search capabilities, reducing search query processing time to  0.005 seconds,10% compared to initial baseline models.
- Deployed the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit, with visualizations to enhance user engagement.

### Obesity Estimation Based on Lifestyle Variables in R  - Statistical Analysis in R	 [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/jagath_96)                 Fall 2024
- Formulated testable hypotheses (ANOVA, chi-square tests, t-tests) to analyze the relationship between BMI and lifestyle factors (more than 12 factors).
- Conducted regression analyses on multiple response variable types (continuous, count, proportion/rate) to evaluate the impact of lifestyle variables on obesity risk.
- Interpreted statistical findings for reliability and validity to derive actionable insights.
