## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS EXPERIENCE 
### Python Code Generator – Transformer-Based Model | [[Github]](https://github.com/Jags96/CodeGen) |	Spring 2024
- Developed Python code generation models using lightweight large language models (LLMs), including GPT-2, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5. Fine-tuned over 200K+ Python code samples using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA and quantization techniques on multi-GPU setups (NVIDIA A16) using the Accelerate library.
- Designed and executed experiments to benchmark model architectures (124M–3B params), optimizing training via gradient checkpointing and evaluating outputs with cross-entropy loss and code-specific tasks.
- Identified performance tradeoffs across model families and exposed limitations in metrics like perplexity and CodeBLEU, contributing to research on efficient, local LLM-based code generation.


### Research Abstract Summarization Pipeline (Work in Progress) [GitHub]                          May 2025 - Present

### Transportation Company Database Design - MySQL database design | [[Github]](https://github.com/Jags96/transportation_company_database) | Fall 2024
- Designed and developed a Transportation Management Database for managing bookings, vehicle and driver assignments, invoicing, and SaaS subscriptions for a road-based transport company.
- Implemented role-based access controls and business rules to ensure data security and system integrity, including constraints for vehicle and customer assignments.
- Optimized database structure through normalization (1NF to 3NF) to reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity.
- Created detailed documentation outlining database schema, relationships, business rules, and SQL setup instructions for seamless integration and use.
  
### Apartment Recommender – Content-Based Filtering System | [[Github]](https://github.com/Jags96/Score-Apartment-Recommender) |  Fall 2024
- Designed a content-based filtering model to analyze user preferences, generating personalized apartment recommendations (from nearly 10k apartments).
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and pairwise similarity metrics, improving the efficiency of recommendation generation by 20% while reducing computational overhead.
- Implemented a count-vectorizer to improve search capabilities, reducing search query processing time to  0.5 seconds,10% compared to initial baseline models.
- Deployed the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit, with visualizations to enhance user engagement.

### Obesity Estimation Based on Lifestyle Variables in R  - Statistical Analysis in R	| [[Rpubs]](https://rpubs.com/jagath_96) |  Fall 2024
- Formulated testable hypotheses (ANOVA, chi-square tests, t-tests) to analyze the relationship between BMI and lifestyle factors (more than 12 factors).
- Conducted regression analyses on multiple response variable types (continuous, count, proportion/rate) to evaluate the impact of lifestyle variables on obesity risk.
